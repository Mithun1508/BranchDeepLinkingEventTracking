## BranchDeepLinkingSampleApp
## Overview
Welcome to the BranchDeepLinkingSampleApp! This Android app showcases the implementation of Branch's Deep Linking technology. Users can experience deep linking, event tracking, and link sharing within the app.

## Features

## 1. Deep Linking
The app leverages Branch's Deep Linking technology to seamlessly direct users to specific locations within the app.

a) Integrate Branch SDK:

Add the Branch SDK to your Android project using a dependency management system like Gradle.

Initialize the SDK in your application's onCreate method.

b) Configure Deep Linking:

Set up deep linking in your app by specifying the activity and/or fragment that should handle the deep link.

Extract data from the Branch Link in the deep linking handler.

## 2. Event Tracking

1. Use the Branch SDK to trigger events within your app. For example, you might trigger an event when a user completes a specific action.
Track Events on Dashboard:

2. Events triggered using the Branch SDK will be automatically tracked on the Branch dashboard.


## 3. Shareable Branch Links
The app empowers users to generate shareable Branch links directly from within the application using the Branch SDK.


## Nice to Have
 Capture Revenue Values for Commerce Events and Display on Dashboard
 
 ## Integrate Revenue Tracking:
1.Use the Branch SDK to capture revenue values for specific commerce events in your app.

2.These revenue values will be displayed on the Branch dashboard.

## Additional Considerations:

## Configuration on Branch Dashboard:
Configure your app on the Branch dashboard, including setting up deep linking parameters, events, and other relevant settings.

## Publishing the App:
 Use Google Drive or DropBox to host your app's APK (Android) or IPA (iOS) file and use this as the custom URL for your app on the Branch dashboard's Configuration page.

## Testing:
Thoroughly test deep linking, event tracking, and link creation on both Android and iOS devices to ensure a seamless user experience.
